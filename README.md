Note that **batch.lua** is a bit messy and may not exactly fit your needs. You may think of it as an example how different conversion methods can be used automatically according to file's format, dimensions, or clip's size. Also, **process.lua** is only used to feed command line's args to batch processor object. Probably you want to customize both **batch.lua** and **process.lua**.
